# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

###
TASK
Implement the page for the link shared here @
https://www.figma.com/file/N0Tv7yYLf3kfMLQjUncUlx/Design-Task---
PLP?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=mEpvVYQ7GInQPxXk-0

THINGS TO DO

1. Implement the code using HTML & CSS
2. Develop the functional page in React.JS using the next.js framework / Angular.JS or
Vue.JS using the nuxt.js framework.
3. We would like to see if you are aware of Server Side Rendering ( SSR ) and if you
can use the same on your demo.
4. Page has to be responsive for mobile & tablet
5. We will evaluate you for the following:
a. Code structure
b. Naming convention
c. Use of minimum pre-built JS packages
d. Screen size fit
e. Min DOM size
6. SEO settings:
a. Page title
b. Page description
c. Setting of H1&H2 tags
d. Schema settings
e. Use of images with appropriate seo friendly names
f. Use of alt text on images
7. Page needs to be hosted on a public service like @ https://www.netlify.com/ and
shareable so we can evaluate it
8. Code has to be checked into a public github repository , repo has to be named as
follows - Appscrip-task-”candidate name”
9. If you can build the front end content using some mock api , maybe using this @
https://fakestoreapi.com/ , would be great but we are also OK to evaluate you
without it if you are unable to do so.

“We believe you have great potential. All the Best!!”
